# A Study of Selection by SteamVR Tracking and Mouse witha Head-Mounted Display based on Fitts’ Law

An input device by a user’s physical moving allows a computer to interact with on the screen. A common input device(mouse) and a common gesture (selection) in two-dimensional have previously been investigated with varied papers by Fitts’Law. However, using 3D interfaces has not examined as muchas using 2D interfaces.  For example, HTC Vive, a modernhead-mounted display, utilizes a wand that can tracked the movement and action of users and this controller is not fully studied for its performance. Selection is a fundamental task in computer interfaces, and this task enables direct comparison between devices through the ISO 9241-9 method [2]. I proposed using the standard ISO9241-9 method for evaluating selection devices based on Fitts’law [1].
